# Wolves_OpenSCAD_Example

I used https://github.com/brad/Inkscape-OpenSCAD-DXF-Export to convert the PNG file to DXF in an OpenSCAd compatible way. The SCAD file should be pretty easy to get the idea from reading.

It opens the dxf and makes a solid out of it,
makes some letters and extrudes them into a solid,
then, it is just a matter of taking whatever boolean you like.
